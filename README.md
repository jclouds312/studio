# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Installing as a Mobile App (PWA)

This application is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can install it on your mobile device directly from the browser, just like a native app. No app store is needed!

### How to Install:

1.  **Open the App in Your Browser:** Navigate to the application's URL on your smartphone (e.g., Chrome on Android or Safari on iOS).
2.  **Add to Home Screen:**
    *   **On Android (Chrome):** Look for a pop-up prompt at the bottom of the screen asking to "Add to Home Screen" or tap the three-dot menu icon and select "Install app" or "Add to Home screen".
    *   **On iOS (Safari):** Tap the "Share" icon (a square with an arrow pointing up) in the navigation bar, then scroll down and select "Add to Home Screen".
3.  **Launch from Home Screen:** Once installed, you will find the app's icon on your home screen. You can launch it from there for an experience that feels just like a native application.
